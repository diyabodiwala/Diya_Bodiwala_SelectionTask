# GeoAI_DelhiAirshed
This project implements an end-to-end AI-driven land cover classification pipeline for the Delhi Airshed, combining satellite imagery, spatial reasoning, and machine learning. The workflow aligns with IIT Gandhinagar’s selection task and aims to identify land use patterns from Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance data for January 2025.
